//translate array of card into a string of number

//We can use a "+" string to convert five cards into a 6-digit number. Start by adding the five cards to an array, then sort them. Depending on the hand type, prefix the string with a number to indicate its rank, followed by the values of the cards in order. Hereâ€™s the breakdown:
1.Straight Flush: Prefix with "6" and then append the five card values in order.
2.Full House: Prefix with "5". First, append the value of the three matching cards, then append the pairâ€™s value.
3.Flush: Prefix with "4" and then append all five card values in order.
4.Three of a Kind: Prefix with "3". Append the value of the three matching cards, followed by the other two card values in order.
5.High Card: Simply append the five card values in descending order.
After converting both hands into 6-digit strings, we can directly compare the two strings to determine the winner.
